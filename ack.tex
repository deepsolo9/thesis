I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Beng Chin Ooi for his guidance and encouragement throughout the research work. His continuous support led me to the right way. He teaches me the right working attitude which I believe will help me a lot along my whole life. His understanding and guidance provides me a good direction of my thesis.

I would also like to thank Prof. Kian-Lee Tan and Guoliang Li, who help me a lot to edit the paper and give me valuable advice for research.

During this work I have collaborated with many colleagues in the database lab, who have given me lots of valuable comments and ideas. I would like to thank all of them. They are Sai Wu, Su Chen, Vo Hoang Tam, Suraj Pathak, Peng Lu, Yanyan Shen etc. I have really enjoyed the pleasant cooperation and work with these smart and motivated people.

Finally, and most importantly, I would like to thank my parents for their encouragement and support. All of these have helped me a lot to complete my graduate studies and this research work.
